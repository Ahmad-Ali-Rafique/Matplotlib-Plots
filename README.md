## Bar Plot

 Bar plots are useful for visualizing categorical data with rectangular bars representing the quantities or frequencies of each category.

## Scatter Plot

 Scatter plots display individual data points as markers, allowing for the visualization of relationships between two variables.

## Box Plot

 Box plots provide a graphical summary of the distribution of data, including median, quartiles, and outliers.

## Histogram

 Histograms represent the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and displaying the frequency of each bin.

## Heatmaps

 Heatmaps visualize data in a matrix format, where colors represent values, making it easy to identify patterns and trends.
